# full-stack web applications that are truly interactive.

In this project, I have combined React, Node.js, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) in a full-stack,full-featured website, including user-friendly forms for posting articles and comments.
I create an interface from React components, develop a Node.js server, tie in a MongoDB database, and deploy my site on Amazon Web Services.
